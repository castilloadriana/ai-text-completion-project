      "Machine Learning allows systems to identify patterns in data, uncover insights, and improve processes through iterative learning. Instead of writing explicit programming instructions, developers prepare and provide data sets (known as training data) to the machine, which the machine uses to build and refine models.

      "You:  summarize this How to Harvest, Store and Process Apples 30 September 2016, written by Benedict Vanheems gb flag  Apples on a tree Ah, the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness! If you’re lucky enough to have an apple tree groaning with fruit, you’ll want to make the most of this seasonal abundance. Read on to find out exactly when and how to pick apples, and the best ways to store and process them.  Play Knowing When to Harvest Apples You’ve been waiting all season and finally the moment of truth has arrived: sweet and crunchy apples ready for picking! But how do you know they are ready to harvest? Nature offers us some clues.  Apples are ready when the skin color deepens. Fruits at the sides and top of the tree usually ripen first because they receive more sunlight. Ripe fruits should easily come away from the tree, while the presence of windfalls is a sure sign you can start harvesting. If in doubt, a simple taste test should confirm whether your apples are fit to pick!  How to Pick an Apple The best way to pick an apple is to cup it in the palm of your hand, lift it up then give it a gentle twist until it comes away. Each apple should detach complete with its stalk. Always handle apples carefully to avoid bruising the delicate flesh and never tug an apple from the tree or you could damage the fruiting spurs or cause apples nearby to drop.  Take care when picking apples from higher up. Use a stepladder and avoid overreaching or you could lose your balance. Remember, not all apples are ready at the same time, so pick regularly as individual clusters ripen.\n"
